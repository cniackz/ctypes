# ctypes
ctypes

The idea of this repository is to learn from ctypes and the way we can create and populate the structures.

# no lo pierdas

It is the starting file from where we want to understand how to populate and print the structures once populated.
Notice this is a Python Project and the idea is to connect this structures to a C Driver, but that is private part.

# Solution
```py
# Create a pointer to the instance of the structure class
devHandle2 = pointer(structure_deviceData)
```

# Problem
```py
# Created a pointer to the class of the structure

```
